# NUMARK CONVERTER v.1.1

The objective of this project is to copy files from a .m3u file (a playlist) to a selected PATH. 

Note that to be able to do this, you must have the files saved on your system. Downloading a .m3u file without the files or with broken paths will make this program fail.

## Requirements

- If you wish to convert your files to mp3, then youll need to install (ffmpeg)[https://ffmpeg.org/download.html] 

## Changelog

#### 1.1
- Works only in terminal. Needs a couple of libraries that are not bundled to this repository
- If you have ffmpeg installed you can convert the files to mp3
